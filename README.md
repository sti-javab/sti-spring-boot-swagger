This project has been built with IntelliJ

To run the application:
1. Navigate to the Swagger class and press play
2. Open up your browser and paste http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html to get to the Swagger UI
3. If you get the error "Failed to load Remote Configuration": write /v2/api-docs in the search bar
4. From there you can try out the requests from the list under __rest-service__. They have been declared in the class RestService. The other stuff in the Swagger UI are up to you to ignore or explore.


The Spring Boot and Swagger parts have been built following this tutorial:
